    "## 🛠️ Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This section focuses on preparing the environment and installing necessary libraries for the project.  It involves these key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installing Libraries:** 📦 Essential libraries like `google-genai`, `chromadb`, `pdfminer.six`, `kaggle_secrets`, `nltk`, `rank_bm25`, and `sentence_transformers` are installed using `pip`. These libraries provide functionalities for interacting with the Gemini API, managing the vector database, extracting text from PDFs, accessing API keys securely, natural language processing, and semantic similarity calculations.\n",
    "2. **API Key Authentication:** 🔑 The `kaggle_secrets` library is used to securely retrieve the Google API key required for accessing the Gemini API. This ensures that sensitive credentials are handled safely. You will need to create a secret named \"GOOGLE_API_KEY\" with your actual Google Cloud API key in the Kaggle Secrets interface.\n",
    "3. **Initializing Gemini Client:**  A `genai.Client` is initialized using the API key, establishing a connection to the Gemini service for generating embeddings and content. This client will be used throughout the project to interact with the Gemini API.\n",
    "4. **Downloading Data:** ⬇️ The electrochemistry PDF documents used for this project are downloaded from Kaggle Datasets using the `kagglehub` library. These documents form the knowledge base for the question-answering system. Ensure that you have an internet connection for this step.\n",
    "5. **Initializing ChromaDB:** 💾 A ChromaDB client and a collection named \"electroanalchem\" are initialized, using a custom embedding function based on the Gemini API. This sets up the vector database to store and search document embeddings.\n",
    "6. **Sentence Transformer Model:**  A pre-trained Sentence Transformer model ('all-mpnet-base-v2') is loaded using the `sentence_transformers` library. This model is used for calculating semantic similarity during evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing these setup steps, you'll have a fully functional environment ready to run the Electrochemistry Assistant and explore its capabilities."

      "\n",
      "1.  Electrode types.  The working electrode (WE) represents the most important component of an \n",
      "electrochemical cell.  It is at the interface between the WE and the solution that electron transfers \n",
      "of  greatest  interest  occur.    The  selection  of  a  working  electrode  material  is  critical  to \n",
      "experimental  success.    Several  important  factors  should  be  considered.    Firstly,  the  material \n",
      "should  exhibit  favorable  redox  behavior  with  the  analyte,  ideally  fast,  reproducible  electron \n",
      "transfer  without  electrode  fouling.    Secondly,  the  potential  window  over  which  the  electrode \n",
      "performs in a given electrolyte solution should be as wide as possible to allow for the greatest \n",
      "degree of analyte characterization.  Additional considerations include the cost of the material, its \n",
      "ability to be machined or formed into useful geometries, the ease of surface renewal following a \n",
      "measurement, and toxicity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The  most  commonly  used  working  electrode  materials  are  platinum,  gold,  carbon,  and \n",
      "mercury.    Among  these,  platinum  is  likely  the  favorite,  demonstrating  good  electrochemical \n",
      "inertness  and  ease  of  fabrication  into  many  forms.    The  biggest  disadvantage  to  the  use  of \n",
      "platinum, other than its high cost, is that the presence of even small amounts of water or acid in \n",
      "the electrolyte leads to the reduction of hydrogen ion to form hydrogen gas (hydrogen evolution) \n",
      "at  fairly  modest  negative  potentials  (E  =  -0.059  x  pH).    This  reduction  obscures  any  useful \n",
      "analytical signal.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Gold electrodes behave similarly to platinum, but have limited usefulness in the positive \n",
      "potential  range  due  to  the  oxidation  of  its  surface.    It  has  been  very  useful,  however,  for  the \n",
      "preparation  of  modified  electrodes  containing  surface  structures  known  as  self-assembled \n",
      "monolayers (SAMs).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Carbon electrodes allow scans to more negative potentials than platinum or gold, as well \n",
      "as  good  anodic  potential  windows.    The  most  common  form  of  carbon  electrode  is  glassy \n",
      "carbon, which is relatively expensive and difficult to machine.  Carbon paste electrodes are also \n",
      "useful in many applications.  These electrodes are made from a paste of finely granulated carbon \n",
      "mixed  with  an  oil  substrate  like  Nujol.    The  paste  is  then  packed  into  a  cavity  in  an  inert \n",

      "Mercury has historically been a widely used electrode material, primarily as a spherical \n",
      "drop formed at the end of a glass capillary through which the liquid metal is allowed to flow.  It \n",
      "displays  an  excellent  potential  window  in  the  cathodic  direction,  but  is  severely  limited  in  the \n",
      "anodic direction by its ease of oxidation.  A dropping mercury electrode (DME), in which drops \n",
      "are formed and fall off repeatedly during a potential scan, being replaced by a “fresh” electrode \n",
      "every second or so, was commonly in past years the first electrode many students encountered in \n",
      "their studies.  The toxicity of mercury has lead to a limited use these days, though it still is a very \n",
      "useful  surface  in  methods  that  involve  the  preconcentration  of  a  metallic  analyte  prior  to \n",
      "potential scan, such as is done in anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV).  Many practitioners now \n",

    "\n",
    "This section focuses on building a vector database using ChromaDB to store and efficiently search electrochemical document information. This enables the Electrochemistry Assistant to quickly retrieve relevant context when answering user queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧬 Embedding Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom class `GeminiEmbeddingFunction` is created, utilizing the Gemini API to generate embeddings for both documents (`retrieval_document` mode) and queries (`retrieval_query` mode). This function ensures consistent and relevant embeddings for effective search and retrieval. It leverages the advanced language understanding capabilities of the Gemini model to capture the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💾 Initializing ChromaDB\n",
    "\n",
    "A ChromaDB client and a collection named \"electroanalchem\" are initialized, specifying the `GeminiEmbeddingFunction` created earlier. This sets up the database structure and embedding method for storing and accessing document representations. The \"electroanalchem\" collection will hold the embeddings of all the electrochemical documents, enabling efficient similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Adding Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "The extracted text from the PDF documents is added to the ChromaDB collection with unique IDs. This populates the database with the relevant electrochemical information and its corresponding embeddings, ready for retrieval. Each document is assigned a unique ID to facilitate efficient identification and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 Querying and Retrieving\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GeminiEmbeddingFunction` is switched to `retrieval_query` mode for generating query embeddings. This allows the system to create embeddings for user queries that are comparable to the document embeddings. When a user asks a question, the system generates an embedding for the query and searches the ChromaDB collection for documents with similar embeddings, indicating semantic relevance. The most relevant documents are then retrieved to provide context for answering the user's question."

    "## 🧲 Retrieval and Baselining\n",
    "\n",
    "This section focuses on how the Electrochemistry Assistant efficiently retrieves relevant documents from the ChromaDB database to answer user queries. It also describes the baselining process used to compare different retrieval approaches. This retrieval process is a critical step in providing accurate and informative responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Switching to Query Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The `GeminiEmbeddingFunction` is configured to `retrieval_query` mode, ensuring the embedding generation aligns with the purpose of searching for relevant information. This mode optimizes the embeddings for finding documents that are semantically similar to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🗣️ Formulating a User Query\n",
    "\n",
    "A user provides a query, representing their information need, for example: \"What is Cyclic Voltammetry?\". This query is the starting point for the retrieval process, as the system needs to identify relevant documents that can provide an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧬 Query Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gemini API generates an embedding for the user's query, capturing its semantic meaning in vector form. This embedding represents the query's essence in a way that can be compared to the document embeddings stored in ChromaDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Database Search\n",
    "\n",
    "ChromaDB uses the query embedding to efficiently search the database for documents with similar embeddings, indicating semantic relevance. The similarity between the query embedding and the document embeddings is calculated using a distance metric, such as cosine similarity. Documents with higher similarity scores are considered more relevant to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Retrieving Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The system identifies and retrieves the most relevant documents from the database, providing the necessary context for answering the user's query. These documents are then used to generate a comprehensive and informative answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ➕ Baselining with TF-IDF and BM25\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish a baseline for retrieval performance, the system incorporates two well-established retrieval models: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and BM25 (Best Matching 25). These models offer different perspectives on document relevance and serve as benchmarks for comparing the performance of the Gemini-based retrieval approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Identifying Relevant Documents with `get_relevant_document_ids()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_relevant_document_ids()` function plays a crucial role in identifying the documents that are most likely to contain relevant information for a given query. This function utilizes a dictionary called `relevant_docs_per_query` that maps related terms and synonyms to their corresponding document IDs. By analyzing the query and matching its keywords or synonyms to the entries in the dictionary, the function efficiently retrieves a list of potentially relevant document IDs. This approach helps in narrowing down the search space and focusing on the most promising documents for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Evaluating Retrieval Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the effectiveness of the different retrieval approaches, various metrics are employed, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accuracy\n",
    "* Precision\n",
    "* Recall\n",
    "* F1-score\n",
    "* MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)\n",
    "* P@K (Precision at K)\n",
    "* NDCG@K (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at K)\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics provide insights into the quality of the retrieved documents for each model and allow for a comprehensive comparison of their performance."

    "## 💬 Augmented Generation: Answer the Question\n",
    "\n",
    "This section focuses on leveraging the retrieved documents and the Gemini model to generate comprehensive and user-friendly answers to the user's query. This process, known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), combines the strengths of information retrieval and large language models to provide insightful and contextually relevant answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✍️ Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed prompt is constructed, guiding the Gemini model to provide relevant and informative answers based on the retrieved documents. The prompt emphasizes clarity, comprehensiveness, and user-friendliness. It also provides instructions on how to incorporate the retrieved context, format equations, and address potential inaccuracies in the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧲 Contextualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The retrieved documents are integrated into the prompt, providing essential context for the Gemini model to understand the user's question and generate accurate responses. This contextualization enables the model to leverage the relevant information from the retrieved documents and formulate a more informed and comprehensive answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Answer Generation with Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gemini model, a powerful pre-trained transformer model developed by Google AI, processes the prompt and the context from the retrieved documents to generate a natural language answer to the user's query. Gemini's advanced language understanding capabilities enable it to synthesize information from multiple sources and present it in a coherent and informative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📄 Output Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated answer is presented in a clear and readable format, typically using markdown for enhanced readability and clarity. This ensures that the answer is easily understandable and accessible to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ Benefits of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation offers several benefits for question answering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Improved Accuracy:** By grounding the answer generation in relevant context, RAG reduces the likelihood of hallucinations or factual errors.\n",
    "* **Enhanced Comprehensiveness:** The retrieved documents provide a broader knowledge base for the model to draw upon, leading to more comprehensive answers.\n",
    "* **Increased Transparency:** The use of retrieved documents makes the reasoning process more transparent, as the user can see the source of information used to generate the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📏 Semantic Similarity Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the quality and relevance of the generated answer, a semantic similarity evaluation is performed. This evaluation compares the generated answer to the retrieved passages using a pre-trained Sentence Transformer model ('all-mpnet-base-v2'). The model generates embeddings for both the answer and the passages, capturing their semantic meaning in vector form. Cosine similarity is then calculated between the answer embedding and each passage embedding to determine the degree of semantic overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧮 Calculating F1-Score with `calculate_f1_score()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `calculate_f1_score()` function is used to quantify the semantic similarity between the generated answer and the retrieved passages. It utilizes the cosine similarity scores and a relevance threshold to identify passages that are considered relevant to the answer. Based on the relevant and retrieved passages, the function calculates precision, recall, and ultimately the F1-score, which provides a balanced measure of the answer's quality and relevance."

      "PASSAGE: Analytical Electrochemistry:  The Basic Concepts   b)  Cyclic Voltammetry   i)    Introduction.    In  linear  scan  voltammetry  (LSV),  the  potential  applied  to  a  working  electrode is scanned over some potential range of interest as a function of time, while the current  passing at the electrode is measured.  We saw in a previous section that the current – potential  profile  for  LSV  was  peak  shaped  for  an  electroactive  species  undergoing  an  electron  transfer  reaction.    In  cyclic  voltammetry  (CV),  the  potential  scan  is  reversed  at  some  point  beyond  the  peak, and scanned back in the direction of the initial potential.  In a simple CV experiment, the  potential  waveform  applied  to  the  electrode  is  a  triangle,  with  the  initial  and  final  potentials  being the same.  This is illustrated in Figure 17 for a scan between an initial potential of 0.00 V  and a switching potential of -0.50 V, with a final potential of 0.00 V.  For a scan rate of 0.10 V/s,  the cycle takes 10.0 seconds to complete.

Under the appropriate conditions, this is the reaction that  occurs on the forward scan in cyclic voltammetry.  Now remember that the double-sided arrow  indicates that the  oxidized  form of the solution  species can  be regenerated  in  a  gross chemical  sense from the  reduced form (chemical reversibility), meaning that the product is stable on the                                                       \f\n",

Upon reversal of the potential scan, the electrode in  our  example  becomes  more  oxidizing  and  the  oxidized  form  of  the  solution  species  can  be  regenerated from the reduced form now in  the  vicinity of  the  electrode  as  the potential  moves  through the region of the E0’ for the redox couple.  This oxidation reaction can be expressed by     Red    Ox  +  n e-   The current – potential trace for a chemically and electrochemically reversible redox couple with  an E0’ = -0.30 recorded between 0.00 and -0.50 V is shown in Figure 18.  In essence, the cyclic  voltammogram produced is the result of two separate linear scan voltammograms, one beginning  at 0.00 V and ending at the switching potential of -0.50 V, and a second beginning at -0.50 V and  ending  at  0.00  V.

As discussed previously, a change in the applied potential of the working  electrode will always be accompanied by a rearrangement of the ions in the double layer, leading  to a contribution to the signal at each potential from capacitive current.  In the CV experiment, a  capacitive current “envelope” can be obtained when the scan is done in the electrolyte solution  containing no  faradaic  species.  The size of the capacitive  current contribution  is  a  function of  several things, including the area of the electrode and the scan rate.   In  many cases, it is much  smaller  than  the  faradaic  component,  and  can  be  effectively  ignored.    When  necessary,  it  is  possible  to  record  the  background scan  and  digitally subtract it from  the scan  collected  for the  solution of interest.  For most electrode materials, the capacitance ranges from 10 – 40 µF/cm2.2   In Figure 27, the same conditions were used as in Figure 18 except that a capacitive component  (CDL)  equivalent  to  40  µF/cm2  has  been  added.    The  current  –  potential  profile  recorded  in  electrolyte solution only is shown as the blue trace.  The red trace shows the CV scan for a 1.0  mM solution of redox active material in the same electrolyte with the same capacitive component  included.

      "Note  that  under  the  conditions  of  Figure  27,  the  charging  current  contributes  very  little  to  the  cyclic  voltammogram.    Under  different  conditions,  however,  the  CDL  can  be  quite  significant.    Shown  in  Figure  28  are  two  cyclic  voltammograms  (CVs)  for  which  only  one  simulation  condition was changed for each from those used to produce Figure 27.  At left, the concentration  of electroactive species was reduced from 1.0 mol/cm3 to 0.05 mol/cm3.  At right, the scan rate  was  increased  from  0.10  V/s  to  100  V/s.    Each  change  brought  about  an  enhancement  of  the  observed charging current relative to the faradaic current.  It should be noted that high scan rates  like  that  used  in  Figure  27,  right  are  not  routinely  employed  with  conventionally-sized  electrodes, but work quite well at ultramicroelectrodes, discussed in a separate section.   Figure 28    (left:  Ci = 0.05 mol/cm3, ν = 0.10 V/s; right: Ci = 1.0 mol/cm3  , ν = 100 V/s)   0.20  A µ  , t n e r r u C  0.00  -0.20  Ci = 0.05 mol/cm3  0.40  Α m  , t n e r r u C  0.00  -0.40  ν = 100 V/s  0.00           -0.10                             -0.30                             -0.50  0.00           -0.10                             -0.30                             -0.50  Potential, Volts  Potential, Volts  2)  Solution Resistance.  An additional factor that must be considered in the application of sweep  voltammetric  methods  is  that  of  solution  resistance.    In  a  normal  three-electrode  cell,  the  potential  of  the  working  electrode  (WE)  is  maintained  at  the  desired  level  relative  to  the  reference  electrode  (RE)  by  a  device  called  a  potentiostat.    We  have  seen  how  changing  the  applied potential, Ea, at the WE allows us to do work in the form of oxidation or reduction of a  solution species in the vicinity of the E0’ for the redox pair.  Since current must pass in the cell to  accomplish  this  work,  the  resistance  of  the  solution  to  charge  movement  (i.e.,  current)  will  be  responsible for a potential drop between the electrodes in the cell, called the Ohmic drop.  The  magnitude of the Ohmic drop, EiR  , is given by Ohm’s Law   EiR  =  icell R  s   where  icell  is  the  current  flowing  in  the  cell,  and  Rs  is  the  solution  resistance.    In  essence,  the  potential observed by a solution species at the WE is now lower in magnitude than that indicated  by the potential measuring device.                                                 \f\n",
      "The solution resistance is composed of two components in the three electrode cell:  that  between  the  auxiliary  electrode  (AE)  and  the  reference  electrode,  designated  Rc,  and  that  between the reference electrode and the working electrode, Ru.  Rc and Ru refer to compensated  and  uncompensated  resistance,  respectively.    By  design,  the  three  electrode  potentiostat  uses  negative electronic feedback between the AE and the RE to “compensate” for the potential drop  between those two electrodes, essentially adding in extra potential equal to icellRc to that being  applied at the WE.  The potential drop between the WE and the RE is not compensated directly  by the potentiostat.  In most applications, proper location of the RE tip near the WE, many times  by  use  of  a  Luggin  capillary,  can  minimize  the  effect  of  icellRu  on  the  applied  potential.    In  addition,  some  commercial  instruments  are  available  with  hardware  and  software  capabilities  designed to reduce or eliminate Ru.   Effects of uncompensated resistance are most evident under conditions resulting in large  amplitude  currents  (high  concentrations,  large  electrode  area,  fast  scan  rates)  or  involving  low  dielectric  solvents  (many  organic).    A  general  observation  for  voltammetry  is  that  current  –  potential  curves  tend  to  be  drawn  out  over  extended  potential  ranges.    In  cyclic  voltammetry,  values  for  ∆Ep,  the  separation  between  the  forward  and  reverse  peak  potentials,  are  increased  over  theoretical  values.    Peak  currents  are  also  reduced  below  those  predicted  for  reversible  systems  by  the  Randles  –  Sevcik  equation.    Similar  effects  are  also  seen  for  slow  rates  of  heterogeneous  electron  transfer,  and  one  must  take  care  to  differentiate  between  the  causes.    Increases  in  ∆Ep  with  scan  rate  which  result  from  slow  kinetics  will  remain  the  same  for  differing  concentrations  of  the  analyte  of  interest,  while  the  effect  will  be  decreased  for  lower  concentration if the result of solution resistance.14   Figure  29  shows the drawing  out of CV waves  resulting from uncompensated  solution  resistance as the scan rate increases.

      "PASSAGE: Analytical Electrochemistry:  The Basic Concepts   b)    Cyclic Voltammetry   ii)  Important parameters in CV.  Cyclic voltammograms are most often characterized by:   a) the location of the forward and reverse peaks on the potential axis (Ep and ∆Ep, allowing the  calculation of E0’); b) the ratio of currents observed on the reverse and forward scans (ip,rev / ip,  fwd);  and  c)  the  dependence  of  peak  currents  on  the  scan  rate  (ip  vs.  ν1/2 ).    As  before,  an  uncomplicated, chemically and electrochemically reversible redox system will first be described.   Next,  deviations  from  the  reversible  case  will  be  presented,  and  the  resulting  changes  in  the  appearance  of  the  voltammograms  obtained  will  be  used  as  diagnostic  criteria  for  electrode  reaction mechanisms of varying types.   Peak Location.  In the forward scan of a cyclic voltammogram, the conditions that exist  at the surface of the electrode are the same as those we have previously described for linear scan  voltammetry.  For conditions that include an electrode product that is stable on the time scale of  the  potential  scan,  the  presence  of  a  return  peak  in  cyclic  voltammetry  allows  us  to  now  determine the formal potential for a redox couple, E0’  , by averaging the two peak potentials   '0  E  =  E  f,p  +  E  r,p  2  where Ep,f and Ep,r represent the forward and reverse peak potentials, respectively.  The position  of  the  E0’   is  characteristic  of  a  redox  species  in  much  the  same  way  that  the  wavelength  of  maximum absorbance is characteristic of a species in spectroscopic experiments.     The  separation  between  the  two  peak  potentials,  ∆E  ,  can  be  used  determine  the   p  electrochemical reversibility for a redox couple, with  .0  ∆  E p =  058 n  for the reversible case (∆Ep in volts).  This value is independent of the scan rate for fast electron  transfer.  Increasing values of ∆Ep as a function of increasing scan rate indicates the presence of  electrochemical  irreversibility.    The  value  of  ∆Ep  can  be  used  in  the  calculation  of  the  heterogenous electron transfer rate constant (ks  ) for the redox reaction.       In  practice,  the  theoretical  value  of  (58/n)  mV  for  ∆E  p  is  seldom  observed.    A  known  reversible  standard  compound  (like  ferrocene  or  ferricyanide)  is  often  helpful  in  the  measurement of practical values for ∆Ep under the specific experimental conditions being used  in the characterization of an unknown compound.  The ∆Ep is also useful in the determination of  n-values, as a two-electron transfer (n = 2) will give about 29 mV for the reversible case.   Current ratios.   In cyclic voltammetry, we are given the opportunity to directly observe  the stability of the electrochemically generated product.  If the product is stable on the time scale  of the experiment, the peak current observed for the return potential scan (ip,r) should be equal to                         \f\n",
      "that seen for the forward potential scan (ip,f directions.   ) given reversible electron transfer reactions in both   i  i  r,p  f,p  =  0.1  The measurement of peak current is sometimes complicated by the difficulty in locating a  proper “baseline” from which to define the magnitude of a peak.  If no other peaks are present,  the  baseline  for  the  forward  wave  can  generally  be  defined  by  extrapolating  the  zero  current  portion of the scan to a position under the forward peak.  The reverse peak current is more often  problematic,  with  baselines  affected  by  the  location  of  the  switching  potential,  among  other  things.    Proper  extrapolation  of  baselines  for  peak  current  measurement  in  the  absence  of  complications is shown  at left in the Figure 19.   Many computer-controlled  potentiostats have  data systems that can accurately and quickly make these types of measurements.  For situations  where baseline assignment is more complicated, the current ratio can sometimes be conveniently  calculated  using  the  empirical  method  of  Nicholson7,  which  requires  the  measurement  of  the  forward  (ip,f)  and  reverse  peak  currents  (designated  (ip,r)0  to  differentiate  it  from  that  used  , which is the current measured  previously) from the same baseline, along with a third current, iλ at the switching potential.  This method is illustrated at right in Figure 19. (DigiElch simulation  conditions same as in Figure 18.)

      "Scan Rate  Dependence of Peak Current.  We learned in our discussion  of LSV that the  observed peak current on the forward potential scan is given for the case of reversible electron  transfer by the Randles-Sevcik equation (at 25 o C)   ip  = (2.69 x 105) n3/2 A D1/2 Ci v  1/2   Thus,  peak  currents  will  increase  linearly  as  a  function  of  the  square  root  of  the  scan  rate  for  reversible  electron  transfer.    Plots  of  ip  vs.  ν1/2   are  useful  in  the  characterization  of  electrochemically  reversible  redox  systems.    Deviations  from  linearity  are  indicative  either  of  complications in the kinetics of the observed electron transfer, or the result of chemical changes  which occur as a result of the electron transfer (homogeneous reactions).     p / ν1/2  A  similar  indicator  of  reversible  electron  transfer  is  called  the  current  function,  whose  value is given by (i ).  The current function should be constant for all scan rates for which  the electron transfer is fast enough to maintain the equilibrium ratio between the reduced and the  oxidized forms of the redox couple predicted by the Nernst equation.    At  this  point,  it  is  instructive  to  note  that  when  describing  electrochemical  reversibility  it  is  s, the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant,  important to consider not only the value of k but the scan  rate  as  well.    It should  be clear that even for large values of ks there exists some  values  of  scan  rate  for  which  Nernstian  equilibrium  cannot  be  maintained  at  the  electrode  surface.    At  these  scan  rates,  the  observed  voltammetry  will  display  characteristics  of  quasi- reversible  or  irreversible  behavior,  such  as  the  drawing  out  of  voltammetric  peaks  over  wider  potential ranges, decreased peak currents, and increased values for ∆Ep  .           \f\n",

      "PASSAGE: Analytical Electrochemistry:  The Basic Concepts   b)    Cyclic Voltammetry   iii)    Chemical  reactions  coupled  to  electron  transfer  .    Until  now,  we  have  mostly  considered electron transfer reactions resulting in electrode products that are stable on the time  scale of the experiment.  In this section, electron transfer reactions that are subject to follow-up  homogeneous chemical reactions will be described.  The simplest example of such a reaction can  be expressed as                     k -    Red     Z  Ox  +  n e  c   where Z represents a product which, unlike Red, can no longer be converted back to Ox by direct  electron  transfer.    The  value  of  kc,  the  rate  constant  for  the  chemical  step,  determines  how  quickly  Red  reacts  to  form  Z.    We  have  encountered  this  situation  before  in  our  discussion  of  chemical reversibility.  Recall that for large values of kc, the redox couple Ox/Red is described  as being chemically irreversible on the time scale of the experiment.  If kc is small (or zero), the  observed couple will be chemically reversible.  For intermediate values of kc , the couple is said  to have limited chemical reversibility.   Cyclic voltammetry is an excellent technique to probe chemical changes that occur as a  result  of  electron  transfer.    For  reactions  that  are  not  completely  chemically  reversible,  the  current observed on the return scan will be diminished.  Further, since scan rate can be controlled  in CV, it is possible in many cases to increase ν until the follow-up step is outrun.  In this way,  the value of k   can often be determined.   c  Many  combinations  of  electron  transfer  and  chemical  reaction  steps  are  possible.     Electrochemists  often  use  a  shorthand  notation  to  describe  these  various  electrode  processes,  denoting  an  electron  transfer  step  as  “E”  and  chemical  steps,  either  before  or  after  electron  r  for  a  reversible  electron  transfer,  as  “C”.    Subscripts  allow  further  differentiation,  such  as  E transfer,  and  Ei   for  an  irreversible  one.    The  most  commonly  encountered  of  these  electrode  mechanisms will be described here.     The  mechanism  considered  above  is  classified  as  ErCi reversible  electron   ,  with  an  ErCi  Mechanism.  electrochemically  irreversible  homogeneous step to form Z.  In this case, no significant equilibrium exists between Red and Z,  and Z is electrochemically inactive in the scanned potential range.

      "Cyclic  voltammograms  simulated  for  various  scan  rates  and  a  value  of  kc    =  10  s-1  are  shown  below.  At the slower scan rates, enough time elapses between the initiation of Ox reduction and  the reoxidation of Red to allow complete conversion to Z, and no return oxidation is seen.  For  fast scan rates, the follow-up step can be outrun, and all Red is reconverted to Ox on the return  scan.  Between the extremes of slow and fast scan rate, values of (ip,r / ip,f) increase from zero to  unity.    Theoretical  working  curves  can  be  used  to  calculate  the  value  of  the  rate  constant,  kc,  from the observed current  ratios.8   (DigiElch simulation parameters:   v = 1  - 10 V/s; A  = 0.10  cm2; Ci = 1.0 mol/cm3; D = 1.0 x 10-5cm2/s; α = 0.50; ks = 100 cm/s; Keq = 10,000; kc = 10 s-1  )   Figure 20   1 V/s  2 V/s  5 V/s  10 V/s  s p m A  , t n e r r u C  3.0E-04  2.0E-04  1.0E-04  0.0E+00  -1.0E-04  -2.0E-04  kc = 10 s-1  0.0  -0.1  -0.2  -0.3  -0.4  -0.5  Potential, Volts  Additional evidence for the presence of this mechanism is an observed shift in the cathodic peak  potential (for a reduction) to more positive values as the scan rate is increased.  The magnitude of  this shift has a theoretical value of (30 / n) mV for each 10x increase in the scan rate.  9   ErCr Mechanism.  This mechanism differs from the ErCi  mechanism in that the chemical step is  now reversible, meaning that the concentrations of the reduced form of the redox species, Red,  and the product of the chemical step, Z, are maintained at values under equilibrium control.   Er:  Ox  +  ne-       Red   Cr  :     Red     Z   Thus,  the  system  will  be  under  the  control  of  both  the  magnitude  of  the  homogeneous  rate  constant (kf in this case) and the equilibrium constant K, where K = kf  / kb.  During the return  potential scan, the concentration of Red in the vicinity of the electrode becomes smaller as it is  converted back to Ox.  As this occurs, the equilibrium between Z and Red will try to maintain  itself  by  converting  Z  into  Red.    The  result  is  an  enhanced  anodic  peak  current  at  slow  to  intermediate scan rates (relative to kf).  At very slow scan rates, the peak current ratio, (ip,r / ip,f),  will approach  the  chemically  reversible value of 1.0.   At fast scan  rates, the peak  current ratio  decreases  with  increasing  scan  rate,  the  opposite  effect  of  that  observed  for  the  ErCi  case.                                                                                \f\n",
      "Further, for the ErCr case, a shift in the cathodic peak potential (for a reduction) to more negative  values is observed as the scan rate is increased.   The peak current ratio can be used to distinguish between the two mechanisms.  Plots of  the current ratio, (ip,r / ip,f), as a function of the scan rate for the both the ErCi and the ErCr cases  are shown below.  (After Figure 19 in Ref 8.)

In this mechanism, the product of the electrochemical reaction undergoes a  chemical  reaction  with  a  nonelectroactive  solution  species  to  regenerate  the  starting  material.

Er:     Ox  +  ne-  Red  Ci’:    Red   + Z   Ox + Y  As  a  first  consideration,  it  will  be  assumed  that  Z  is  present  in  the  solution  at  a  large  concentration,  representing  pseudo  first-order  conditions.    Thus,  the  regeneration  of  Ox  is  controlled by the magnitude of kc.  If kc is small relative to ν, the observed voltammetry appears  reversible, and peak current ratios approach unity.  As the magnitude of kc increases, the amount  of Ox that is catalytically regenerated during a potential sweep is increased, with the shape of the  corresponding voltammograms transitioning between diffusion control and steady-state behavior.   This is illustrated in the Figure22.  The same behavior is observed for a single value of kc as the  scan  rate  is  decreased.    If  scans  are  continued  to  potentials  well  negative  of  the  reduction  potential,  the  limiting  currents  will  converge  to  the  same  value  regardless  of  the  scan  rate  as  steady-state conditions are  reached.

      "CrEr Mechanism.  In this mechanism, the electroactive starting material is itself the product of a  chemical reaction.   Cr:     Z     O  Er:    Ox  +  ne-     Red   The  quantity  of  Ox  initially  available  for  reduction  is  dependent  upon  the  magnitude  of  the  equilibrium constant K between Z and Ox.  For large values of K, the equilibrium lies far to the  right,  favoring  the  electrochemical  species  Ox.    The  observed  voltammetry  for  this  case  is  generally  indistinguishable  from  the  chemically  reversible  case,  with  peak  current  ratios  approaching unity for all scan rates.   Small  values  for  K  limit  the  availability  of  Ox,  and  lead  to  the  appearance  of  cathodic  current  plateaus  rather  than  peaks,  indicative  of  steady-state  conditions.    Steady-state  in  this  context refers to  the situation  in which  the  concentration of  the  electroactive  material  reaching  the surface of the electrode is unchanging with time and potential.  Ox is supplied for reduction  only  at  the  rate  allowed  by  the  equilibrium  (and  specifically  kf),  with  the  current  magnitude  being independent of scan rate.  The current observed on the return scan is peak shaped, as Red  produced on the forward scan reaches the electrode under diffusion control.  The magnitude of  the anodic current is much larger than the steady-state current measured on the cathodic plateau.   This  is  the  result  of  additional  Ox  that  is  formed  in  the  equilibrium  shift  from  Z  to  Ox  as  the  initial concentration of Ox is removed by conversion to Red.    For very fast scan rates, reversible behavior is observed as only the initial concentration  of  Ox  contributes  to  the  observed  current  on  the  time  scale  of  the  experiment.    In  general,  differing combinations of magnitude for Keq (Figure 24, left) and ν (Figure 24, right) will show  varying effects of each, as illustrated in the simulated voltammograms in Figure 24.

      "ErCiEr  Mechanism.    In  general,  a  homogeneous  reaction  sandwiched  between  two  electron  transfers defines an ECE mechanism.  As one might imagine, the addition of a second electron  transfer step leads to a good deal more complexity than in previous cases.  The simplest system  will be considered first – one in which a reversible electron transfer occurring at E0 1 is followed  by an irreversible chemical step to form an electroactive product (A) whose reversible electron  transfer occurs at a value for E0  2 that is more negative (for a reduction) than E0  1.   Er:    Ox  +  ne-     Red   E0  1         kc   Ci:     Red     A   Er:    A  +  ne-     B    E0  2 > E0  1   If  on  the  forward  scan,  the  potential  is  reversed  well  before  the  potential  where  A  begins  to  reduce, the behavior of the system will mimic that of the ErCi case, with the peak current ratio  (ip,r  / ip,f) dependent upon the value of kc relative to the scan rate ν.  If  on the other hand, one  continued  the  potential  scan  through  the  region  containing  E0 2,  the  reduction  of  A  would  be  observed for those conditions in which sufficient time passed to allow the product to form.   The magnitude of the current observed for the reduction of the homogenous product A is  dependent upon the size of kc and on the scan rate ν.  For large kc/slow ν, the cathodic current  for  this  reduction  will  be  close  to  that  observed  for  the  initial  reduction  of  Ox  (given  similar  values for n and D).  On the return scan, as B in the diffusion layer is oxidized back to A, anodic  current enhancements may be observed that result from the continued production of A from Red  during the entire time period in which the potential is greater than E0 1.  The oxidation peak for  Red    Ox  +    ne-  may  not  be  present  at  longer  times  and  larger  values  of  kc.    Figure  25  illustrates the effect of increasing kc at a single scan rate in the ErCiEr mechanism in which the  reduction  potential  E0 1.

On the return scan, the size of the anodic peak corresponding to the oxidation of  Red to Ox, will be diminished in proportion to the amount of A formed during the forward scan.

      "One of the strengths of the CV technique in the identification of electrode mechanisms is that we  need not restrict ourselves to single scans that are initiated and completed at the same potential.   For example, for the ECE case illustrated in Figure 26, we chose to continue the scan past the  initial point, and scanned back in the cathodic direction to a potential that was negative of E0 .  This allowed the cathodic feature  of the product  electrochemical  couple  (A/B) to be observed.  By controlling the initial, switching, and final potentials, along with the number of scans, more  complicated  mechanisms  can  be  probed.    Imagine  what  you  might  see  if  the  product  of  the  homogeneous reaction following electron transfer to Ox itself underwent homogeneous reaction  to form an electrochemically active product.

      "PASSAGE: Analytical Electrochemistry:  The Basic Concepts   c)  Anodic Stripping Voltammetry  .     Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) is the most common of a class of techniques known  as stripping electroanalytical methods (SEAM).  The defining characteristic of these methods is  the preconcentration of analyte at the electrode surface in order to lower the detection limit for  that analyte.15  ASV involves the accumulation of electroactive material at the electrode by the  application of a potential well negative of its E0 ’ value.  Usually a mercury drop or mercury thin- film  electrode  is  employed  under  forced  convective  conditions  (stirred  solution).    The  preconcentration step is followed by a short time period in which the solution is allowed to quiet  (no  stirring),  following  which  a  potential  scan  is  initiated  from  the  deposition  potential  in  the  anodic direction.     ASV is well-suited for the determination of trace amounts of many metal contaminants.   “Stripping” refers to the characteristic sharp voltammetric waves that occur for metals as they are  oxidized out of mercury, in which many metals form amalgams.  Approximately a dozen metals  can be conveniently  analyzed  using ASV,  with  more than a dozen  more  elements  amenable to  analysis with slight modification of the basic technique.  16   The concentration of the reduced metal following the deposition step is generally 100 –  1000 times the original solution concentration.  Deposition times range from ca. 30 seconds for  -7  M  up  to  more  than  20  solutions  containing  metal  ions  at  concentrations  on  the  order  of  10 minutes for those down to 10-10 to 10-11 M.17   Standard solutions containing known quantities of  each analyte are used to calibrate the stripping response.  The current magnitude (peak height) or  charge  (peak  area)  of  the  anodic  wave  may  be  used  to  quantify  unknown  amounts  of  analyte.    Experimental conditions, such as rate of stirring and deposition time must be carefully controlled  to assure reproducibility of results.   Most commonly, a linear potential sweep is used for anodic stripping.  Peak potentials are  characteristic  of  each  analyte,  and  frequently  multiple  metals  can  be  analyzed  in  a  single  measurement.    The  stripping  peak  current  observed  at  a  hanging  mercury  drop  electrode  o (HMDE) is given (at 25   C) by   ip  =  2.72 x 105 n3/2 A D1/2 ν1/2 C  M   where n = number of electrons involved in the oxidation, A is the electrode area in cm2, D is the  diffusion coefficient for the metal within the mercury drop expressed in cm2/s, ν is the scan rate  in V/s, and CM is the concentration of the metal within the mercury drop given as mol/cm3 .  For  a mercury film deposited on the surface of an inert substrate (like C or noble metal), the stripping  peak current is given by   2 Fn  i  p  =  CIA  2  2/1  ν TR7.2  M                    \f\n",
      "where F is the Faraday (9.65 x 104 C), I is the mercury film thickness in cm, and other symbols  are as defined previously.   Typical results for the ASV analysis of Cd, Pb, and Cu contained in 0.10 M KNO3/5%  HNO3  electrolyte  at  a  concentration  of  1.0  ppm  and  1.0  ppb  are  shown  in  shown  Figure  30  (www.cypresssystems.com/Experiments/asv.html).18    A  thin  mercury  film  was  formed  at  the  surface of a 1 mm glassy carbon electrode during the deposition step from mercuric nitrate added  to the cell at a concentration of 30 ppm.  The deposition step was 130 seconds, with the solution  being stirred for the first 120 seconds.  The scan rate was 1000 mV/s.   Figure 30   1.0 ppm  1.0 ppb  Improved  detection  limits  are  possible  in  ASV  when  using  potential  waveforms  other  than the linear sweep described above.  Most are “step” methods that take advantage of the fact  that  the  capacitive  (background)  component  of  the  total  current  observed  following  a  potential  step decays more quickly (as t-1) than does the faradaic component (as t-1/2).  One such technique,  differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), uses a staircase potential waveform superimposed on the  top of the linear (DC) waveform of LSV.  The waveform is illustrated in Figure 31.     Figure 31   V  , l a i t n e t o P  w  τ2  Es  τ1  Time  A  T                                                                      \f\n",
      "In DPV, the  current is sampled  at two  points  during  a potential  pulse of duration  T.   The first  current measurement is made at some time τ1 prior to the forward step of potential amplitude A,  whose  duration  is  designated  W.  The  second  current  measurement  is  made  at  a  similar  time  period following the potential step, at τ2.  The potential is then stepped back to a point on the DC  ramp (blue dotted line) Es volts higher than the previous step.  The difference between the two  currents is plotted as a function of the applied DC potential.  Using this method, the non-faradaic  component  of  the  current  is  largely  removed,  and  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  is  enhanced.    More  information  on  DPP  and  other  pulse  techniques  can  be  found  at  http://www.epsilon- web.net/Ec/manual/Techniques/Pulse/pulse.html.  19   Cathodic  stripping  analysis  (CSV)  involves  an  anodic  deposition  step  followed  by  a  potential  scan  in  the  cathodic  direction.    Applications  of  CSV  include  many  organic  and  inorganic compounds, and anions, which form insoluble salts with mercury.20           \f\n",

During the forward scan, a species (Ox) is reduced ($Ox + ne^- \\rightleftharpoons Red$), and if the product (Red) is stable, the reverse scan re-oxidizes it ($Red \\rightleftharpoons Ox + ne^-$), yielding a current-potential trace.\n",

    "## 🎉 Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the successful implementation of a question-answering system for electrochemistry, leveraging the power of Google's Gemini model, ChromaDB, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). By combining these technologies, the system efficiently extracts relevant information from electrochemical documents and generates comprehensive, user-friendly answers to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Effective Retrieval:** The system effectively retrieves relevant documents using a combination of Gemini embeddings, TF-IDF, and BM25 retrieval models, achieving high accuracy and retrieval performance metrics.\n",
    "* **High-Quality Answers:** The Gemini model, guided by carefully engineered prompts and enriched with retrieved context, generates answers that are accurate, informative, and semantically aligned with the source material.\n",
    "* **Semantic Similarity:** The semantic similarity evaluation, based on Sentence Transformer embeddings and the `calculate_f1_score()` function, confirms the strong correlation between generated answers and relevant passages, highlighting the system's ability to capture and synthesize information.\n",
    "* **Versatile Applications:** The Electrochemistry Assistant has the potential to be a valuable tool for education, research, customer support, and decision-making in the field of electrochemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Expanding the Knowledge Base:** Incorporating more diverse and comprehensive electrochemical documents to enhance the system's knowledge and coverage.\n",
    "* **Fine-tuning the Gemini Model:** Fine-tuning the Gemini model on a specialized electrochemistry dataset to further improve its understanding and response generation capabilities.\n",
    "* **Exploring Advanced Retrieval Techniques:** Investigating and implementing more advanced retrieval techniques, such as hybrid approaches or neural retrieval models, to further enhance retrieval performance.\n",
    "* **User Interface Development:** Developing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system, making it more accessible and intuitive for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The Electrochemistry Assistant represents a significant step towards building intelligent systems that can effectively access and utilize domain-specific knowledge. By automating the process of information retrieval and answer generation, this system has the potential to revolutionize how researchers, students, and professionals interact with electrochemical information, empowering them with valuable insights and accelerating scientific discovery."
