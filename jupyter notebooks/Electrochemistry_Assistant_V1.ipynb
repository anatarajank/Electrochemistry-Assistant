    "## 📝 Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This project showcases a question-answering system powered by Google's Gemini model and ChromaDB for efficient information retrieval.  The system leverages cutting-edge Gen AI techniques for understanding and responding to user queries about electrochemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Processing:** 📄 Extracts text from PDF documents related to electrochemistry using `pdfminer`.\n",
    "2. **Embedding Generation:** 🧬 Creates embeddings for the extracted text using the Gemini API and stores them in a ChromaDB vector database.\n",
    "3. **Query Processing:** 🔎 Generates embeddings for user queries using the Gemini API.\n",
    "4. **Retrieval:** 🧲 Searches the vector database for relevant documents based on the query embeddings.\n",
    "5. **Answer Generation:** 💬 Uses the Gemini model with a prompt enriched by the retrieved documents to answer the user's question in a comprehensive and user-friendly way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ Gen AI Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Embeddings:** 🧬 Used to represent documents and queries as vectors, enabling semantic search for relevant information.\n",
    "* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** 🧲 Retrieves relevant context from the document database to enhance the answer quality and accuracy.\n",
    "* **Document understanding:** 📄 Allows the system to process and understand information from PDF documents containing electrochemical knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌟 Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficient and accurate information retrieval:** Quickly finds relevant answers to questions about electrochemical concepts.\n",
    "* **User-friendly responses:** Provides clear, comprehensive, and informative answers in a conversational style.\n",
    "* **Advanced Language Understanding:** Utilizes the powerful Gemini model for accurate comprehension and generation of natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Potential Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Educational tool:** 📚 Aids in learning and understanding electrochemical principles.\n",
    "* **Research assistant:** 🔬 Assists in exploring and analyzing electrochemical literature.\n",
    "* **Customer support chatbot:** 🗣️ Answers questions about electrochemical products or services."

    "## 🛠️ Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This section focuses on preparing the environment and installing necessary libraries for the project. Key steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installing Libraries:**  📦 Essential libraries like `google-genai`, `chromadb`, `pdfminer.six`, and `kaggle_secrets` are installed using `pip`. These libraries provide functionalities for interacting with the Gemini API, managing the vector database, extracting text from PDFs, and accessing API keys securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **API Key Authentication:** 🔑 The `kaggle_secrets` library is used to securely retrieve the Google API key required for accessing the Gemini API. This ensures that sensitive credentials are handled safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initializing Gemini Client:** A `genai.Client` is initialized using the API key, establishing a connection to the Gemini service for generating embeddings and content."

This function ensures consistent and relevant embeddings for effective search and retrieval.\n",

    "3. **Add Documents:** 📄 The extracted text from PDF documents is added to the ChromaDB collection with unique IDs. This populates the database with the relevant electrochemical information and its corresponding embeddings, ready for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Query and Retrieve:** 🔎 The embedding function is switched to `retrieval_query` mode for generating query embeddings. A user query is then used to search the database, retrieving the most relevant documents. This demonstrates how ChromaDB enables efficient information retrieval based on semantic similarity."

      "PASSAGE: Analytical Electrochemistry:  The Basic Concepts   b)    Cyclic Voltammetry   ii)  Important parameters in CV.  Cyclic voltammograms are most often characterized by:   a) the location of the forward and reverse peaks on the potential axis (Ep and ∆Ep, allowing the  calculation of E0’); b) the ratio of currents observed on the reverse and forward scans (ip,rev / ip,  fwd);  and  c)  the  dependence  of  peak  currents  on  the  scan  rate  (ip  vs.  ν1/2 ).    As  before,  an  uncomplicated, chemically and electrochemically reversible redox system will first be described.   Next,  deviations  from  the  reversible  case  will  be  presented,  and  the  resulting  changes  in  the  appearance  of  the  voltammograms  obtained  will  be  used  as  diagnostic  criteria  for  electrode  reaction mechanisms of varying types.   Peak Location.  In the forward scan of a cyclic voltammogram, the conditions that exist  at the surface of the electrode are the same as those we have previously described for linear scan  voltammetry.  For conditions that include an electrode product that is stable on the time scale of  the  potential  scan,  the  presence  of  a  return  peak  in  cyclic  voltammetry  allows  us  to  now  determine the formal potential for a redox couple, E0’  , by averaging the two peak potentials   '0  E  =  E  f,p  +  E  r,p  2  where Ep,f and Ep,r represent the forward and reverse peak potentials, respectively.  The position  of  the  E0’   is  characteristic  of  a  redox  species  in  much  the  same  way  that  the  wavelength  of  maximum absorbance is characteristic of a species in spectroscopic experiments.     The  separation  between  the  two  peak  potentials,  ∆E  ,  can  be  used  determine  the   p  electrochemical reversibility for a redox couple, with  .0  ∆  E p =  058 n  for the reversible case (∆Ep in volts).  This value is independent of the scan rate for fast electron  transfer.  Increasing values of ∆Ep as a function of increasing scan rate indicates the presence of  electrochemical  irreversibility.    The  value  of  ∆Ep  can  be  used  in  the  calculation  of  the  heterogenous electron transfer rate constant (ks  ) for the redox reaction.       In  practice,  the  theoretical  value  of  (58/n)  mV  for  ∆E  p  is  seldom  observed.    A  known  reversible  standard  compound  (like  ferrocene  or  ferricyanide)  is  often  helpful  in  the  measurement of practical values for ∆Ep under the specific experimental conditions being used  in the characterization of an unknown compound.  The ∆Ep is also useful in the determination of  n-values, as a two-electron transfer (n = 2) will give about 29 mV for the reversible case.   Current ratios.   In cyclic voltammetry, we are given the opportunity to directly observe  the stability of the electrochemically generated product.  If the product is stable on the time scale  of the experiment, the peak current observed for the return potential scan (ip,r) should be equal to                         \f",

If no other peaks are present,  the  baseline  for  the  forward  wave  can  generally  be  defined  by  extrapolating  the  zero  current  portion of the scan to a position under the forward peak.  The reverse peak current is more often  problematic,  with  baselines  affected  by  the  location  of  the  switching  potential,  among  other  things.    Proper  extrapolation  of  baselines  for  peak  current  measurement  in  the  absence  of  complications is shown  at left in the Figure 19.   Many computer-controlled  potentiostats have  data systems that can accurately and quickly make these types of measurements.  For situations  where baseline assignment is more complicated, the current ratio can sometimes be conveniently  calculated  using  the  empirical  method  of  Nicholson7,  which  requires  the  measurement  of  the  forward  (ip,f)  and  reverse  peak  currents  (designated  (ip,r)0  to  differentiate  it  from  that  used  , which is the current measured  previously) from the same baseline, along with a third current, iλ at the switching potential.
